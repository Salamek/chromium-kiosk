CLEAN_START: true  # Force chromium to clean start on each boot (That simply means do not show "Restore pages" dialog, you want this to be true in 99% of use cases)
KIOSK: true # Run in kiosk mode, chromium will use whole screen without any way for user to close it, setting this to false is useful for web application debug (you can access chromium Inspect tool and so on) and initial chromium configuration
TOUCHSCREEN: true # Enables support for touchscreen
URLS: # List of urls to load, other urls are loaded as other tabs (on background in this case)
